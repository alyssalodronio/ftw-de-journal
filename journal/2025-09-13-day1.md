# Day 1: SQL & ELT Basics

## What is Data Engineering? üßê

* **A Simple Definition**: At its core, data engineering is the process of **moving data from one place to another** so it can be stored, cleaned, and made useful.

## Core Responsibilities of a Data Engineer
These tasks are often prioritized by the value they deliver to the business.

1.  **Extract and Load**: Pull data from various sources (APIs, databases, files) and load it into a central system like a data warehouse.
2.  **Transform**: Clean, model, and structure the raw data to prepare it for analysis and generate insights.
3.  **Learn & Optimize**: Apply Machine Learning (ML) or AI models to the prepared data to discover patterns and make predictions.
4.  **Serve**: Deliver the final insights to end-users through applications, dashboards, or reports.

## Key Principles in Data Engineering

* **The Power of Scale**: A data engineer's primary strength is building systems that can handle massive volumes of data efficiently.
* **The Learning Curve**: The basics are straightforward, but mastery is difficult due to the countless *edge cases* and unexpected issues that arise in real-world scenarios.
* **The Reality of Tradeoffs**: A huge part of the job is making decisions and balancing competing priorities, such as:
    * Cost vs. Performance
    * Speed of delivery vs. Perfection
    * Complexity vs. Maintainability

## The Data Life Cycle
This cycle describes the entire journey of data, from its creation to its eventual removal. Understanding these stages is fundamental to data engineering. 

1.  **Data Generation & Collection**:
    * This is the initial creation or capture of raw data.
    * *Examples*: User activity on a website (clicks, page views), transaction records from a point-of-sale system, logs from servers, data from IoT sensors.

2.  **Ingestion & Storage**:
    * This involves moving the raw data from its source into a central repository.
    * *Examples*: Using data pipelines to load data into a **data lake** (like Amazon S3) for raw storage, or a **data warehouse** (like ClickHouse or Snowflake) for structured storage.

3.  **Processing & Transformation**:
    * This is where raw data is cleaned, structured, and enriched to make it reliable and ready for analysis. This is the "T" in ELT/ETL.
    * *Examples*: Running SQL scripts or `dbt` models to standardize date formats, join different tables, remove duplicates, and aggregate data into summary tables (marts).

4.  **Analysis, Visualization & Serving**:
    * This stage is where the processed data is used to generate business value.
    * *Examples*: Business analysts querying the data warehouse for reports, creating dashboards in tools like Tableau or Power BI, feeding data into ML models for predictions.

5.  **Archiving**:
    * Moving older, less frequently accessed data to cheaper, long-term storage solutions. This is done for cost-saving and compliance.
    * *Examples*: Shifting historical logs from an active data warehouse to a cold storage solution like Amazon Glacier.

6.  **Destruction**:
    * Permanently and securely deleting data that is no longer needed or is required to be removed by law.
    * *Examples*: Removing a user's personal data upon request to comply with regulations like GDPR, or purging old, irrelevant logs.
